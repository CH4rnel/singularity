/**
 * Product analytics for the wallet.
 *
 * One call — `analytics.track(event, properties)` — and everything a row needs
 * beyond that is filled in here: the anonymous installation id, the session,
 * the platform, the app version, the client's own clock. A call site that had
 * to remember to pass those would eventually forget, and the events that
 * matter most are the ones written in the middle of a signing flow where
 * nobody is thinking about analytics.
 *
 * Four properties hold this together, in order of importance:
 *
 *   It cannot break the wallet. Every entry point swallows its own errors,
 *   nothing awaits the network, and a dead endpoint costs a queued event and
 *   nothing else. Sending money must never depend on a metrics server.
 *
 *   It cannot carry a secret. Properties go through the same allowlist the
 *   server enforces, and the two shapes a wallet secret takes — a long run of
 *   hex, a run of words — are refused inside it. There is no field for a seed
 *   phrase, a key, a password or a signed payload to occupy.
 *
 *   It is not a fingerprint. The identity is a UUID this device minted and
 *   keeps; nothing reads a canvas, a font list, a screen size or a hardware
 *   id, and the request omits credentials so the endpoint cannot see which
 *   account the browser is signed into. A browser that says "do not track" is
 *   not tracked.
 *
 *   Its retries are free. Every event carries an id, the server's index is
 *   unique on it, so a replayed outbox is dropped rather than double-counted.
