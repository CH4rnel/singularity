/**
 * The wallet's one way of becoming somebody.

 * subject is a *person* and not a key, and writing in the feed, which needs an
 * author — and both get there the same way: the wallet signs the site's own
 * login challenge, and the answer becomes an ordinary session cookie.
 *
 * Nothing about custody changes. What the server learns is an address that
 * proved it can sign, which is the same thing the login page learns from
 * MetaMask.
