    | The two people who build this product also use it, and on a chain this
    | young they use it more than anyone: as of this writing 68 of 70 recorded
    | swaps on the site were theirs. Left in, every conversion rate on the
    | console is a self-portrait — it says the funnel converts, because the
    | operator converts every time they test the thing they just deployed.
    |
    | So internal installations and internal sessions are excluded from the
    | product numbers by default. Two rules, because there are two ways an
    | operator is recognisable:
    |
    |   - `wallets` — an address seen on an installation. The two console keys
    |     always count; these are the extras, because a wallet used for testing
    |     is not necessarily the one that opens /crm.
    |   - `user_ids` — accounts on this site, for `site_events`, which has a
    |     user id where the product tables deliberately do not. The console's
    |     own admin ids always count; these are the extras.
    |
    | Excluding is not hiding: every report that drops internal rows also says
    | how many it dropped, and `?internal=1` puts them back. A number that got
    | quietly smaller is the other way a dashboard lies.
