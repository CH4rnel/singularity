/**
 * Broadcast a bridge relay tx so a lost broadcast ACK can never double-pay.
 *
 * Two failure modes plagued the naive `wallet.sendTransaction(...)`:
 *
 *  1. Nonce race — the relayer EOA is shared (bridge relayer + Telegram minter
 *     + DCA bot), so a relay tx races another tx from the same account for a
 *     nonce and is rejected with "replacement transaction underpriced" /
 *     "nonce too low". We wait it out (no gas bump — that would cancel the
 *     other account's legitimate tx) until the competing tx clears the nonce.
 *
 *  2. Lost broadcast ACK — a flaky RPC accepts eth_sendRawTransaction into the
 *     mempool but drops the HTTP response, so the client throws even though the
 *     tx is live. `wallet.sendTransaction` populates+signs+broadcasts in one
 *     opaque step and only yields the hash on a clean ACK, so on this error the
 *     hash is lost. A blind resend then rebuilds a *fresh nonce* once the first
 *     tx mines → a second, duplicate payout.
 *
 * The fix: populate and sign ONCE up front so the tx hash is known before the
 * first broadcast, then (re)broadcast that exact signed tx. Resending the same
 * signed bytes is idempotent — the node dedupes by hash ("already known") — so
 * a lost ACK is recovered by returning the known hash instead of resending a
 * different tx. A fresh nonce is only rebuilt when we prove OUR tx can never
 * mine (its nonce was consumed by a different tx and no receipt exists for our
 * hash), which is safe because our original never landed.
