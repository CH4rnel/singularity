# Cyberia Mobile

Capacitor shell that ships the Cyberia site (`backend/laravel`) as an Android and
iOS application.

Like the desktop shell it renders the live site rather than bundling it: the
native app is a WebView pointed at `https://cyberia.church`, so a production
deploy updates the app without a store release. The only local payload is
`www/`, the page shown when the site cannot be reached.

**The app is the Cyberia wallet.** It launches on `/wallet`, which renders
without the site header and footer inside a native shell and fills the screen
instead. The rest of Cyberia is a link away in the wallet's masthead; every
other route keeps the normal site chrome. The wallet needs no Cyberia account —
the keys are generated and encrypted in the browser — so the app is usable
straight after install.

## Requirements

- Node 20+ (Capacitor 8) — always installed.
- **Android:** JDK 21 and the Android SDK (`platform-tools`, `platforms;android-36`,
  `build-tools;36.0.0`). Point `ANDROID_HOME` at the SDK before building.
- **iOS:** macOS with Xcode 16+. Dependencies are Swift Package Manager, so no
  CocoaPods install is needed.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run www             # regenerate the local fallback pages
npm run sync            # www + copy config/plugins into android/ and ios/
npm run assets          # regenerate icons and splash screens from resources/
npm run open:android    # open the project in Android Studio
npm run open:ios        # open the workspace in Xcode
npm run android:apk     # sync + assembleDebug -> android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
npm run android:release # sync + bundleRelease -> .aab for Play
npm test                # URL/navigation rules, no SDK needed
```

`android/` and `ios/` are committed: they carry the deep-link intent filters,
the URL scheme, and the generated icons, none of which Capacitor can regenerate
from config alone.

## Configuration

`CYBERIA_APP_URL` (default `https://cyberia.church`) decides what the app renders
and which hosts stay inside the WebView; `CYBERIA_APP_PATH` (default `/wallet`)
decides which route it launches on. Both are baked into the native project at
sync time, so re-sync after changing either:

```bash
CYBERIA_APP_URL=http://192.168.1.10:8000 npm run sync:android
CYBERIA_APP_PATH=/swap npm run sync:android
```

An `http://` URL automatically enables cleartext traffic for that build; anything
that is not `http`/`https` falls back to production. `CYBERIA_APP_PATH` must be a
same-origin absolute path: a full URL or `//host` falls back to `/wallet` rather
than pointing the whole app at another origin.

## Behaviour

- **Navigation** — `cyberia.church`, its subdomains, and the OAuth providers open
  in the app. Every other URL, including `wc:`, `metamask:`, `phantom:`, and
  `tg:`, is handed to Android/iOS, which is exactly what WalletConnect needs to
  hop into a wallet app and back.
- **Offline** — a failed load shows `www/error.html` (`server.errorPath`), which
  returns to the site as soon as the device is online.
- **Deep links** — `cyberia://feed` works on both platforms. `https://cyberia.church`
  links open the app once the site publishes the association files: set
  `APP_ANDROID_SHA256_FINGERPRINT` (and `APP_IOS_APP_ID`) in the Laravel `.env`,
  which turns on `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` and
  `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`. On iOS also add the
  `applinks:cyberia.church` associated domain in Xcode — it needs a provisioning
  profile, so it is deliberately not committed.
- **Safe areas** — the WebView draws edge to edge (`ios.contentInset: 'never'`);
  the site pads itself with `env(safe-area-inset-*)`, which is why
  `app.blade.php` sets `viewport-fit=cover`.
- **User agent** — `CyberiaMobile/<version>` is appended so the site can tell it
  is running inside the app (`resources/js/lib/native.ts`).
- **Local vault** — Android backup is disabled, so the encrypted wallet vault
  and WebView storage stay on the device instead of entering a cloud backup.

## Signing and release

`android:release` produces an unsigned bundle. Add a keystore in
`android/keystore.properties` (git-ignored) and the matching `signingConfigs`
block in `android/app/build.gradle` before uploading to Play, then publish the
key's SHA-256 through `APP_ANDROID_SHA256_FINGERPRINT`.

## Known limits

- **Web push does not reach the app.** Android WebView has no Push API, and iOS
  WKWebView only supports it for home-screen PWAs. The site's push subscriptions
  keep working in browsers; native notifications need
  `@capacitor/push-notifications` with FCM/APNs.
- **Store review is not guaranteed.** Apple's guideline 4.2 treats thin web
  wrappers poorly and 3.1.5(b) restricts crypto exchange functionality to the
  exchange's own developer account; Google Play has its own crypto policy. Direct
  APK distribution from cyberia.church has no such constraint.
- No in-app wallet is injected — the WalletConnect path is what mobile users get,
  same as mobile browsers.
